Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a paper-and-pencil game for 
two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who 
succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is 
the winner [**Source**: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)].

The main purpose of the project was to become accustomed with packaging projects and 
distributing them on PyPi.
